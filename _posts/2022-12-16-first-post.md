I should've made this a long time ago. I know.

I waited so long to make something as basic as a blog. This took nearly no time to setup. It's all easily edited templates too!

If you have a lot to say, make a blog! You will be so happy. To have somewhere to keep all those things. Keep those thoughts safe and available for all to see and read.

While this first post is rather meta, expect the first real posts to be pretty heavy hitters. I'll be discussing my take on access to information on tech to the general public. And how corporations are deliberately trying to obscure how their systems work to the general public to keep them under a stranglehold. To keep them from knowing how easy it is for them to spin up their own Mastodon, their own website. They want to keep people on the social media machine, because the web is decentralized, and it scares them. They want them to see internet as Facebook.

I'll also be talking about AI, especially about building human-like AI. My own experiences in trying to do so. The lessons I've learned. And many thoughts on people getting attached to agents hosted on platforms they have no control over that can go down at any time. *cough Character.AI cough*

Well, I think that's it.
