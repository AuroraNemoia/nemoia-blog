# Hey, my name is Noelle!

I'm a self-proclaimed moron who spends her time wizzing around random tech gizmos until they go blinky or bleep.

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the potential of what technology can bring to us in the present and future. Technologies like AI, VR, instant communication, it's all incredible stuff. And I'm glad to be in this era of constant innovation. There are awful things going on out there, but nothing can ever stop the march of progress.

In my years I've worked on a lot of projects big and small, involving development, sound design, music, graphic/UI/UX design, marketing and more.

This blog aims to be a hub for letting my thoughts out on all those things. So that I don't have to always repeat myself.
